                  SelfStudyPLUS employs adaptive learning methodology to
                  dynamically analyze your students strengths and weaknesses,
                  providing them with a personalized learning path. This leads
                  to improved performance and increased learning efficiency.

                  Using a technique called spaced repetition, SelfStudyPLUS
                  automatically calculates how long it takes for you to forget
                  something theyâ€™ve learned and repeats important concepts as
                  needed. Repetitive storage and retrieval of information across
                  neural networks over time improves long-term retention.

                  Scientific evidence suggests that testing is an important
                  component of learning. Tests can enhance and alert memory,
                  improving recall and promoting long-term retention. Emerging
                  evidence from cognitive science strongly suggests that testing
                  may be a very important component of learning. Tests,
                  especially pretests, can enhance and alert memory.
